The contributions of this paper are as follows:

* conceptualisation and refined definition of operational LTO cycle;
* surface trajectory based description of taxi sub-phases; and 
* initial use-case analysis of the proposed approach.

## Background

### ICAO LTO Cycle

ICAO defines LTO Cycle [@icaoAnnex16Vol22017].

Based on the LTO cycle, the fuel burn of an aircraft is determined by the specific sub-phase, i.e. mode, and its associated thrust setting. 
The latter can then be expressed as an engine specific fuel-flow rate.
In general, the total fuel burn $F_i$ of an aircraft with engine E for flight i is then the sum of the fuel burn per each sub-phase:
$$F_i = \sum_p (f_{ip} * t_{ip}) $$
a given taxi
phase of a flight is calculated by multiplying the time
spent at each phase by a fuel-flow rate of the engine type
for the corresponding phase.
