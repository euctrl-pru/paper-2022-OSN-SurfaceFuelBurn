# paper-2022-OSN-SurfaceFuelBurn
This repo is the work bench for the invited talk at the Opensky Network Symposium 2022. Under the umbrella of the PRC work programme, PRU is working on the estimation of gate-to-gate fuel burn (and associated emissions). Approaches to the estimation of fuel burn during the taxi phase revolve around the LTO assumptions (i.e. time-in-mode and thrust settings). Previous research has shown that this approach overestimates the taxi fuel burn. With a view to enhance the basic LTO based approach, this paper identifies enhancements to the LTO approach based on open ADSB data.
